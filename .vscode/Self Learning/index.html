        <h1>preparing a Document for the world wide web</h1>
        <p>creating HTML pages takes planing, but the results are worthwhile.</p>
        <p>Imagine the exitement of having your web page seen by people all over the world.</p>
        <p>Keep your Web pages to a few screens each. you can link information, so don't worry about including everything at once.</p>
        <p>Remember that  readers do not always find your home page first.
            A link from somewhere else can lead them to the middle of your information, so try not to use words like next <br /> to indicate navigation on your paper
